    <p>
      Filipino Chicken Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines and like
      all traditional dishes, there are many variations – including different
      proteins like pork and beef. Fundamentally though, the key ingredients are
      the right balance of soy sauce, vinegar, black pepper and sugar that
      create an incredibly sticky glaze that has a depth of flavour like it’s
      been slow cooked – but it’s not!
