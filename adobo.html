    <p>
      Filipino Chicken Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines and like
      all traditional dishes, there are many variations – including different
      proteins like pork and beef. Fundamentally though, the key ingredients are
      the right balance of soy sauce, vinegar, black pepper and sugar that
      create an incredibly sticky glaze that has a depth of flavour like it’s
      been slow cooked – but it’s not!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Marinade</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        750g / 1.5 lb chicken thigh fillets , boneless and skinless (5 - 6
        pieces)
      </li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves , minced</li>
      <li>
        1/3 cup (85ml) soy sauce , ordinary all purpose or light (not dark soy
        sauce)
      </li>
      <li>1/3 cup + 2 tbsp white vinegar</li>
      <li>4 bay leaves (fresh) or 3 dried</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp oil , separated (vegetable, canola or peanut)</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves , minced</li>
      <li>1 small brown onion , diced</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (375 ml) water</li>
      <li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tbsp whole black pepper (sub 2 tsp coarse cracked pepper)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Instruction</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at
        least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from
        marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until
        browned – about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the
        way through.
      </li>
      <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a
        simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no
        need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce
        reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the
        sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return
        chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.
      </li>
      <li>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice.</li>
    </ol>
